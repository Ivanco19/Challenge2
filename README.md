# Challenge2
- In this challenge we built a macro to get a summarise table for every year (2018:2020) with the following data: Ticker, yeraly change, percent change and total stock volume.
- We also got the ticker with the highest % increase and the lowest % descrease. 
- This macro also applies conditional formating to the percent change column and quickly visualize if it is a positive or negative change.
- It is able to run the analysis for all tabs in just one click.

- You can find the code source in the parent folder.

- This macro/code was developed by Ivan Corona
