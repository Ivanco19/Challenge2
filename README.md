# Challenge2
- In this challenge we built a macro to get a summarise table for every year (2018:2020) with the following data: Ticker, yeraly change, percent change and total stock volume.
- We also got the ticker with the highest % increase and the lowest % descrease. 
- This macro also applies conditional formating to the percent change column and quickly visualize if it is a positive or negative change.
- It is able to run the analysis for all tabs in just one click.

- I split the challenge into 2 sub-routines. The first one "Year_stock_calculation" has all the code and logic to build a summarise table with the information for the CURRENT tab (year)
- In the second sub-routine "Year_stock_worksheet" we call the first sub-routine to run the logic for all the tabs (2018, 2019, 2020).

- You can find screenshots of the results of the analysis for the years 2018 - 2020

- This macro/code was developed by Ivan Corona
